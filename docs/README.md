   - Follow the examples in the [Customization Guide](customization_guide.md#modifying-key-bindings)

## Common Tasks

### Using the Web Interface

1. Start DogPuter: `python -m dogputer`
2. Look for the URL displayed on screen (e.g., http://192.168.1.10:5000)
3. Scan the QR code or enter the URL in a browser on any device on your network
4. Use the drag-and-drop interface to:
   - Map commands to keys
   - Upload new videos
   - Manage configurations

### Adding a New Button Action

1. Create image file: `images/new_action.jpg`
2. Create sound file: `sounds/new_action.wav`
3. Optionally create video file: `videos/new_action.mp4`
4. Edit `configs/keymappings/development.json` (or your preferred config) to add:
   ```json
   "K_n": "new_action"
   ```
5. Alternatively, use the web interface to drag-and-drop the action to a key
6. Restart DogPuter (not needed if using the web interface)

### Adding a New Video Channel

1. Add your video file to `videos/` (e.g., `new_channel.mp4`) 
   - You can upload directly through the web interface
2. Edit `configs/content/videos.json` to add:
   ```json
   {"name": "New Channel", "video": "new_channel.mp4"}
   ```
3. Edit your key mapping configuration to add:
   ```json
   "K_n": "video_newchannel"
   ```
   - Or use the web interface's drag-and-drop feature
4. Restart DogPuter (not needed if using the web interface)

### Changing an Existing Key Binding

1. Edit the appropriate configuration file in `configs/keymappings/`
2. Change the action assigned to a key, for example:
   ```json
   "K_1": "ball"  // Change from "rope" to "ball"
   ```
3. Alternatively, use the web interface to:
   - Remove the existing mapping by clicking the "Ã—" button
   - Drag a new action to the key
4. Restart DogPuter (not needed if using the web interface)

### Uploading New Videos

1. Prepare videos in MP4 format named according to the command (e.g., `ball.mp4`)
2. Open the web interface in a browser
3. Go to the "Upload" tab
4. Drag and drop your video files onto the upload area
5. New videos are immediately available for mapping to keys
