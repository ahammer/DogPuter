## Understanding the System Architecture

DogPuter uses a modular architecture that separates different aspects of the system:

- **Input Handling**: Processes keyboard, joystick, and X-Arcade controller inputs
- **Content Management**: Manages videos, images, and sounds
- **Actions**: Maps inputs to specific behaviors in the application

When an input event occurs (like a button press), the system:
1. Uses the input mapping configuration to determine which action to perform
2. Plays the corresponding sound
3. Displays the associated image or video
4. Uses text-to-speech to vocalize the action

## Input Mappings and Actions

### Available Actions

DogPuter comes with the following built-in actions:

- Basic actions: `play`, `rope`, `ball`, `hugs`, `outside`, `walk`, `water`, `park`, `toy`, `bed`
- Video channel actions: `video_squirrels`, `video_birds`, `video_dogs`, `video_cats`, `video_water`

Each action is associated with:
- A sound file (e.g., `ball.wav`)
- An image file (e.g., `ball.jpg`)
- A video file if available (e.g., `ball.mp4`)

### Modifying Key Bindings

Key bindings are defined in JSON configuration files located in the `configs/keymappings/` directory. The default configurations are:

- `development.json`: Uses number keys and arrow keys, suitable for development and testing
- `x-arcade-kb.json`: Configured for X-Arcade controllers in keyboard mode
- `x-arcade-gc.json`: Configured for X-Arcade controllers in gamepad mode

To modify key bindings:

1. Open the appropriate configuration file in a text editor
2. The configuration uses Pygame key constants as keys and action names as values:

```json
{
  "K_0": "play",
  "K_1": "rope",
  "K_2": "ball",
  "K_UP": "video_squirrels",
  "K_RIGHT": "video_birds"
}
```

3. To add a new binding, add a new key-value pair:
   - The key should be a valid Pygame key constant (e.g., `K_a` for the 'A' key)
   - The value should be the name of an action

Common Pygame key constants:
- `K_0` through `K_9`: Number keys
- `K_a` through `K_z`: Letter keys
- `K_UP`, `K_DOWN`, `K_LEFT`, `K_RIGHT`: Arrow keys
- `K_SPACE`: Space bar
- `K_RETURN`: Enter key

4. Save the file and restart the application for changes to take effect

### X-Arcade Controller Mappings

X-Arcade controllers can be used in two modes:

1. **Keyboard Mode**: The controller emulates keyboard presses
2. **Gamepad Mode**: The controller functions as a joystick/gamepad

To modify X-Arcade mappings:

1. For keyboard mode, edit `configs/keymappings/x-arcade-kb.json`
2. For gamepad mode, edit `configs/keymappings/x-arcade-gc.json`
3. The X-Arcade configuration uses logical button names that map to physical buttons:

```json
{
  "p1_up": "video_squirrels",
  "p1_down": "video_dogs",
  "p1_left": "video_cats", 
  "p1_right": "video_birds",
  "p1_button1": "ball",
  "p1_button2": "rope"
}
```

4. Save the file and restart the application for changes to take effect

### Joystick Mappings

Joystick mappings use a tuple format to identify joystick inputs:

```json
{
  ("button", 0, 0): "ball",
  ("button", 0, 1): "rope",
  ("hat", 0, "up"): "video_squirrels",
  ("hat", 0, "down"): "video_dogs"
}
```

Where:
- First element is the input type (`button` or `hat`)
- Second element is the joystick ID (usually 0 for the first joystick)
- Third element is the button number or hat direction

To customize joystick mappings:

1. Edit the appropriate configuration file for your setup
2. Add or modify the joystick tuples with the desired actions
3. Save the file and restart the application

## Adding and Updating Videos

### Video File Requirements

- Format: MP4 (recommended) or any format supported by MoviePy
- Resolution: Match your display resolution (e.g., 1280Ã—720)
- Name: Must match an action name (e.g., `ball.mp4` for the `ball` action)

### Adding New Videos

1. Create a video file with the appropriate name (matching an action)
2. Place the video file in the `videos/` directory
3. Ensure there is a corresponding image file in the `images/` directory with the same base name
4. Ensure there is a corresponding sound file in the `sounds/` directory with the same base name
5. Restart the application

### Configuring Video Channels

Video channels are configured in `configs/content/videos.json`:

```json
{
  "video_channels": [
    {"name": "Squirrels", "video": "squirrels.mp4"},
    {"name": "Birds", "video": "birds.mp4"},
    {"name": "Dogs", "video": "dogs.mp4"},
    {"name": "Cats", "video": "cats.mp4"}
  ]
}
```

To add or modify video channels:

1. Open `configs/content/videos.json` in a text editor
2. Each channel requires:
   - `name`: The display name of the channel
   - `video`: The video file to play (must be in the `videos/` directory)
3. Add, remove, or modify the channel entries as needed
4. Save the file and restart the application
5. Update your key bindings to include actions for the new channels (e.g., `video_newchannel`)

## Adding and Updating Sounds

### Sound File Requirements

- Format: WAV (recommended)
- Name: Must match an action name (e.g., `ball.wav` for the `ball` action)

### Adding New Sounds

1. Create a sound file with the appropriate name (matching an action)
2. Place the sound file in the `sounds/` directory
3. Ensure there is a corresponding image in the `images/` directory
4. Optionally add a corresponding video in the `videos/` directory
5. Update your key bindings to include the new action
6. Restart the application

## Testing Your Changes

After making changes to configurations, it's recommended to:

1. Run DogPuter with the default configuration: `python -m dogputer`
2. Test all modified actions to ensure they work as expected
3. If using a custom configuration, run with that config: `python -m dogputer --config your_config_name`
4. Check that all key bindings, videos, and sounds are working correctly

If you encounter issues:
- Check the console output for errors
- Verify that all file paths and names are correct
- Ensure all configuration files are valid JSON
- Confirm that the action names in your key bindings match the names of your media files
